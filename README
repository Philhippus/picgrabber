So I thought it would be interesting to use winsock to extract the images off a webpage and store them in OpenCV's
IplImage format all spruced and ready for processing.

I've used TR1's regex to parse HTML for image links - and it works up to the point where the image is getting DL'ed.
I may have some tweaking to do perhaps having to parse the image headers as it comes down the pipe.

The code is a work in progress and some things are automated at the moment that you might not need; like selecting
an image of your own to be compared by OpenCV - you might want to comment that out as there's no actual image processing
coded in yet.

Also there's a random travel website that is connected to when the code runs - this was just for debugging purposes so that
I didn't have to manually enter a URL each time.
