So I thought it would be interesting to use winsock to extract the images off a webpage and store them in OpenCV's
IplImage format all spruced and ready for processing.

I've used TR1's regex to parse HTML for image links - and it works up to the point where the image is getting DL'ed, 
then I get the 'connect failed' message from winsock - could be the regular expression's fault or something else.

The code is a work in progress and some things are automated at the moment that you might not need. Like selecting
an image of your own to bee compared by OpenCV - you might want to comment that out. Also there's a random travel 
website that is connected to when the code runs - this was just for debugging purposes so that I didn't have to manually
enter a URL each time.
